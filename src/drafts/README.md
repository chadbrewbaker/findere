# Drafts

## What is this folder?

This folder contains:
- several Python scripts used to check the output of QTF
- some old functions of QTF written in a C++ file

Those files and functions should have been removed from this repository and only retrievables throughth git's history. But for the sake of practicality, they have been copied here (so that they are retrievables throughth CTRL+f as well :) ). Chances are high that you do not need what's inside those files.
