# Sources

## What is this folder?

This folder contains the sources of QTF as well as a main function.

The main function is used to index and query with QTF and can be used as an example of how to use QTF in your own program.

The folder libraries contains the sources of QTF, while the drafts folder contains, well, only drafts (not used by the source code of QTF).
